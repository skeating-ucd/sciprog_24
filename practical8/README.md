# Practical 8

This folder contains practical 8 code

GCD.c defines two functions for calculating the greatest common divisor of two integers.  
It requests the user to input two integer values.  
It then prints the greatest common divisor as calculated by the two seperate functions.  
One function is defined iteratively.  
The other is recursive.  

## Compile:

* gcc -o GCD GCD.c -lm

## Execute:

* ./GCD

Please provide two integer values:  
(user input) 7 11  
The greatest common divisor (iterative) for (7,11) is : 1  
The greatest common divisor (recursive) for (7,11) is : 1

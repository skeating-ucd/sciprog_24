# Practical 3

This folder contains code for practical 3

## Overview

Compute the area under the curve of f(x) over [a,b] using trapezodial rule. In this case for Tan(x) from [0,pi/3].

## Compile

* gcc -o Integrate Integrate.c -lm

## Execute

* ./Integrate

The integral from 0 to Pi/3 is 0.695
The difference between our calculation and Log(2) is 0.002
